interview questions:

	Q: Have you used collections framework? Can you introduce it
	A: Yes, Collections framework provides an architecture to store and 
	   manipulate a group of objects. It consists of interfaces and classes
	   that implement those interfaces. 
	
	Q: LinkedList vs ArrayList
	A: Accessing an element in an ArrayList takes constant time, O(1). Adding
	   an element to the front of the ArrayList takes O(n) which is also its
	   worst case scenario. Since ArrayLists are backed by Arrays, when a new
	   array has to be created to copy all the elements and add new ones, it
	   takes O(n). LinkedList takes O(n) time when adding elements and accessing
	   them as well. LinkedList uses more memory as it uses nodes. 
	
	Q: HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap vs HashTable
	A: HashMap stores key-value pairs and it is not synchronized which means it
	   isn't thread safe. HashTable is essentially a synchronized version of 
	   HashMap although implementations are most likely different. 
	   ConcurrentHashMap is a thread safe collection and intended to be used as
	   primary Map implementation for multi threaded environments.  
	
	Q: How to create a new thread
	A: There are two ways to create a new thread. The first way is to write a
	   class that extends Thread. Make sure to overwrite the run method and
	   after initializing the object of the class that extends Thread, run the
	   start method on the instance. Since java does not support multiple 
	   inheritances, the second way is to implement Runnable interface. Just 
	   like before, you need to overwrite the run method. The difference here is
	   when you want to create a thread, you will pass an instance of the class 
	   that implements the Runnable interface into Thread as an argument.  
	
	Q: Can we start a thread twice
	A: Once a thread has completed execution, you will have to create a new 
	   thread and run that. You can't reuse a thread. 
	
	Q: What is synchronized keyword
	A: The synchronized keyword used in blocks of code in Java blocks on a 
	   shared object and can only have one thread executing in the block at a
	   time. 

	Q: What is volatile keyword
	A: The volatile keyword in Java makes sure that all writes to a variable 
	   being declared as volatile will be written back to main memory 
	   immediately. 
	
	Q: What is lock
	A: A lock in Java is a thread synchronization mechanism that handles 
	   synchronizations for threads. 
	
	Q: What's your experience about multi-threading
	A: Just simple problems like producer and consumer or writing several
	   class threads that handle just one small task like printing a letter. 
	
	Q: Abstract classes vs Interfaces
	A: Abstract classes can have methods defined in them and can only be 
	   inherited. Interfaces can be implemented by multiple classes and can
	   only have method signatures.  
	
	Q: What if you what to use user-defined classes as Key in Set/Map
	A: You would put in the class name between the angular brackets. 
	
	Q: How to make a class immutable
	A: Make the class final, make the fields final, don't write setter methods. 
	
	
	Q: What is Garbage collection
	A: Garbage collection is determines what memory that was previously being 
	   used and is no longer being used by the application and it will free up 
	   this memory for other uses.
	
	Q: Checked exception vs Unchecked exception
	A: Checked exceptions are checked at compile time. An example would be 
	   handling FileNotFoundException when we use FileReader. Unchecked
	   exceptions are runtime errors. This can include ArithmeticException 
	   such as attempting division by 0.
